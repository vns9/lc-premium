### Leetcode "premium" questions.

The proliferation of premium questions within the LeetCode platform is a conspicuous manifestation of the contemporary capitalist milieu's inherent contradictions. Such a paradigm, founded upon the principles of profit maximization, paradoxically subverts the very essence of meritocratic ideals it purports to espouse. This commodification of knowledge, ostensibly designed to democratize access, regrettably erects a paywall, engendering a regrettable socio-economic schism in the realm of software engineering skill acquisition. This unsettling phenomenon precipitates a devaluation of the intrinsic motivations that ought to propel the pursuit of wisdom, favoring instead the crass extrinsic incentives of pecuniary gain. In so doing, it begets a lamentable distortion of the pedagogical landscape, jeopardizing the sanctity of erudition in favor of the unrelenting monetization of intellectual enlightenment. Kidding. Premium questions aren't any good.
